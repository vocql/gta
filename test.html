<div class="character-list">
  <div class="character-card" data-name="Vice City" data-img="gta/places/vice.jpg" data-desc="Vice City is Leonida's neon-soaked metropolis where America's glamour, hustle, and greed are turned up to eleven. Pastel art deco towers rise alongside Cuban-influenced neighborhoods, bootleg markets, gorgeous beaches, and endless cruise ships docking in the bay. From the bustling panaderias of Little Cuba to the flashy strip clubs and shady record labels downtown, every corner pulses with opportunity—and danger. If you've got the cash to flash, this is where you make it rain.">

  <div class="character-card" data-name="Leonida Keys" data-img="gta/places/leoninda.jpg" data-desc="The Leonida Keys serve as the tropical gateway to paradise—a laid-back chain of islands where the dress code is casual, the drinks flow freely, and life moves at the speed of a slow-rolling wave. Luxury beachfront spots mix with hidden coves perfect for unwinding, but the stunning turquoise waters hide unpredictable currents, dangerous marine life, and plenty of secrets beneath the surface. It's the ideal spot to kick back with a buzz and a view—just don't drift too far from shore.">

  <div class="character-card" data-name="Grassrivers" data-img="gta/places/grassrivers.jpg" data-desc="Grassrivers is the untamable jewel of Leonida's crown—a vast, primordial swamp echoing the Everglades, where tangled mangroves, murky channels, and thick wetlands stretch as far as the eye can see. Alligators and deadly predators rule the waters, but the real threats are the weirder discoveries lurking just beneath the surface. This is raw, untouched wilderness where nature hides bodies (literal and figurative), and every boat ride or airboat trip feels like venturing into the unknown.">

  <div class="character-card" data-name="Port Gellhorn" data-img="gta/places/port.jpg" data-desc="Port Gellhorn is Leonida’s forgotten coast—a once-thriving tourist town now reduced to cheap motels, abandoned strip malls, shuttered attractions, and empty boardwalks. The tourists never came back, but a new economy took root: fueled by malt liquor, painkillers, truck-stop energy drinks, dirt bikes, and biker gangs. It's gritty, chaotic, and seedy—a perfect hideout for lowlifes, drifters, and anyone running from the law or looking to disappear into the decay.">

  <div class="character-card" data-name="Ambrosia" data-img="gta/places/ambrosia.jpg" data-desc="In the heart of Leonida, Ambrosia is where old-school American industry and values still reign supreme—whatever the cost. Dominated by the massive Allied Crystal sugar refinery, the town provides hard jobs for blue-collar locals while a notorious biker gang supplies almost everything else. Small towns collide with heavy industry, creating a gritty mix of sweat-soaked labor, outlaw loyalty, quiet corruption, and rural backroads. It's a place where the factory whistle and motorcycle engines define the rhythm of life.">

  <div class="character-card" data-name="Mount Kalaga" data-img="gta/places/mount.jpg" data-desc="Mount Kalaga National Park stretches across the remote northern fringes of Leonida, a rugged wilderness of dense forests, winding rivers, deep canyons, and wide-open trails. It's a national off-the-grid landmark drawing hunters, fishers, off-road riders, and reclusive types seeking freedom far from civilization. The terrain is unforgiving and beautiful, offering prime spots for adventure—but also plenty of hiding places for outlaws, mystics, and anyone paranoid enough to vanish into the hills.">
